# About Me

Hello, my name is Richard Ashkettle and I am a Principal Platform Architect at TeleTracking Technologies in Pittsburgh PA (USA).

I have been doing hobby game development since 1978 when I first got my hands on a computer. I will never forget those magic words "West of a White House". It was love at first sight.
